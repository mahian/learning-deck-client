        question: 'How do I select a course?',
        answer: ' Visit the course catalog to browse our offerings. In addition to searching by course duration and availability, you can also search by subject to ensure you find a course that reflects your interests. Though it is not required, we encourage those who have not studied art before to consider taking an art history course first to get a solid grounding in the discipline before exploring more specific disciplines. Our art history courses are the perfect first step before moving on to art market courses.'

        id: 5,
